              We got a number one Victory Royale
              Yeah, Fortnite, we 'bout to get down (get down)
              Ten kills on the board right now
              Just wiped out Tomato Town
              My friend just got downed
              I revived him, now we're heading south-bound
              Now we're in the Pleasant Park streets
              Look at the map, go to the marked sheet
              Take me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today
              You can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake
              I really love to Chug Jug with you
              We can be pro Fortnite gamers
